Equipment library manager

This project is an application built on Django, and styled using Bulma CSS. It aims to facillitate the operations of an equipment library.

# Features
- Manage library inventory from a centralized control panel
- Approve and deny checkouts on a per-item basis
- Return checked out items into the system


# Roadmap to beta release
- [x] User Sign ups
- [x] User profiles
- [ ] User password recovery
- [ ] Audit Logs
- [ ] Reservations
- [ ] Waitlists
- [ ] Searchable tags
- [x] More Item descriptions (features/external links)
- [ ] Media groups (certain items only available for members of X group)
- [ ] Automatically email users for overdue items
- [ ] Frozen accounts (accounts that cannot checkout items)
- [ ] Full text search (very low priority)

# Long-term objectives
- SPA for relevant pages
- GraphQL API
- Explore JWT for auth (but the bandwidth is not so high that scalability would be an issue at the moment)

# Known Bugs
(I've not gone bug hunting yet)
